Calculate the sum of even numbers

Algorithm:

1. Start.
2. Take input  (the upper limit).
3. Set a variable sum to 0.
4. If the number is even (divisible by 2), add it to sum.
5. When the loop ends, print the value of sum.
6. Stop.

Psuedocode:

START  
Take INPUT n.  
SET sum to 0.  
FOR i from 1 to n:  
    CHECK if i is even.  
    IF yes, add i to sum.  
END loop.  
PRINT sum.  
STOP
